To see gazebo opened due to, for instance, how much computer processor utilization:

         roslaunch rt2_ass2 sim_small.launch

To open the user_interface:

Open jupyter notebook, or jupyter lab;
From one of the two programming open "user_notebook_interface.ipynb" situated in the notebook folder

## How are generally the branches structerd:

Main Code for executing the task of the project, doxygen code for executing the project and documentation of doxygen at last sphinx code for executing the project and documentation of the sphinx
