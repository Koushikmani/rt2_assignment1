## How are generally the branches structerd:

Main: Code for executing the task of the project
doxygen: code for executing the project and documentation of doxygen
sphinx: code for executing the project and documentation of the sphinx

## To run the code

Pick a branch, then
Assuming that you need the classical gazebo visualization

         roslaunch rt2_ass2 sim.launch

To see gazebo opened due to, for instance, how much computer processor utilization:

         roslaunch rt2_ass2 sim_small.launch

To open the user_interface:

Open jupyter notebook, or jupyter lab;
From one of the two programming open "user_notebook_interface.ipynb" situated in the notebook folder
